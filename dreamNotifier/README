Dream notifier listens to notifications from Kaa server and displays messages on Dream Cheeky USB LED board. Tested on Ubuntu and Raspbian (yes you can run this on Raspberry!).

NB: This application relies on dcled binary driver that you can obtain from here: http://www.last-outpost.com/~malakai/dcled/
